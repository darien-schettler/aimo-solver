## Introduction

The AIMO Prize competition challenges participants to develop AI models capable of performing as well as top human participants in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) on a dataset of 110 novel math problems. This package is an attempt to tackle this challenge by providing a comprehensive solution that leverages natural language processing and machine learning techniques.

## Features

- Preprocessing and parsing of LaTeX-formatted math problems
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the provided dataset
- Implementation of baseline models and solutions
- Cross-validation and model evaluation
- Inference on test data and submission generation
- Modularized code structure for easy maintenance and extensibility

## Installation

To install and set up the package, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/darien-schettler/aimo-solver.git
   ```

2. Install Poetry, a dependency management tool for Python projects:
   ```
   pip install poetry
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using Poetry:
   ```
   cd aimo-package
   poetry install
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment created by Poetry:
   ```
   poetry shell
   ```

## Usage

Here's a brief guide on how to use the package:

1. Prepare your dataset in the required format and place it in the appropriate directory (e.g., `data/`).

2. Open the main script or Jupyter Notebook and import the necessary modules from the package.

3. Preprocess and parse the math problems using the provided functions and classes.

4. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset to gain insights and understand the problem domain.

5. Implement and train baseline models using the provided model classes and training scripts.

6. Evaluate the trained models using cross-validation and generate performance metrics.

7. Use the trained models to make predictions on the test data and generate submission files.

For detailed usage examples and API documentation, please refer to the package's documentation.
